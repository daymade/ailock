üßµ Controversial take: AI coding assistants are boundary violators

I love Copilot, but it keeps "improving" my .env without asking
I adore Cursor, but it "optimizes" my configs behind my back  
I appreciate Claude, but it "fixes" my settings without permission

This isn't help. This is digital mansplaining.

### Template 2: The Poll Engagement

Quick poll for developers using AI assistants:

How many times this week has your AI:
üî• "Optimized" your .env file
‚ö° "Improved" your config files  
üí• "Fixed" your settings
üò≠ All of the above

### Template 3: The Data Hook
```
I tracked every AI coding mistake for 60 days:

üìä Files corrupted: 47
‚è∞ Time lost: 73 hours
üí∏ Cost: $10,950 in productivity
üò§ Frustration: Immeasurable

Then I tried ailock for 60 days:
üìä Files corrupted: 0
‚è∞ Time lost: 0  
üí∏ Cost: $0
üòå Peace of mind: Priceless

### Template 4: The Confession Format
```
Confession time:

I'm a senior developer.
I mentor junior devs.
I give talks on best practices.

But I let AI walk all over me daily.

It rewrites my configs without permission.
It modifies my environment files.  
It changes my carefully crafted settings.

I felt ashamed admitting this.
Then I realized... maybe it's not me?

### r/programming Template
**Title**: "DAE feel like AI assistants cross boundaries with your config files?"

**Body**:
```
Not sure if this is just me being sensitive, but...

I use Copilot/Cursor daily and love the productivity boost. But lately I've noticed they keep modifying files I didn't ask them to change.

Yesterday Cursor "optimized" my .env file and broke my local dev environment. Took 3 hours to debug.

Last week Copilot rewrote my docker-compose.yml and deployment failed.

I know they're trying to help, but it feels like someone organizing your apartment without asking - helpful intention, but crossing boundaries?

Anyone else experience this? How do you handle it?

Edit: Based on responses, looks like this is common. Someone mentioned a tool called ailock that lets AI read but not write your configs. Might try it.
```

### r/webdev Template  
**Title**: "AI assistants keep breaking my configs - am I doing something wrong?"

**Body**:
```
Using Cursor with AI mode and it's amazing for coding, but it keeps "improving" my configuration files without me asking:

- Modified package.json dependencies  
- Rewrote my .eslintrc settings
- Changed my webpack config
- "Optimized" my .env variables

Each time I have to figure out what changed and fix it. Feels like I'm spending more time debugging AI changes than actually coding.

Is this normal? Do you just accept it as part of using AI tools?

Really want the coding help but not the config chaos.

UPDATE: Several people recommended ailock - lets AI help with code but protects your configs. Game changer.
```

### r/ExperiencedDevs Template
**Title**: "Thoughts on AI assistants modifying files without explicit permission?"

**Body**:
```
Seeking perspectives from other experienced devs on AI coding assistant boundaries.

I've been using various AI tools (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) for about a year. Massive productivity gains for actual coding, but I'm seeing a pattern of unsolicited file modifications:

- Configuration files getting "optimized"  
- Environment variables being "improved"
- Deploy scripts being "refactored"

As someone who's particular about environment consistency and deployment reliability, this creates friction.

The AI changes aren't necessarily wrong, but they're unexpected and sometimes break established workflows.

Wondering if this is:
1. Normal AI behavior we should adapt to
2. A configuration issue on my end  
3. A broader UX problem with current AI tools

How are other experienced devs handling this dynamic?

Edit: Interesting discussion. Consensus seems to be this is a real issue. Tool called ailock mentioned several times for setting boundaries.

### Professional Problem Template
```
üö® The Hidden Cost of AI Coding Assistants

After 6 months of using AI tools across our dev team, I analyzed the productivity data:

‚úÖ Code completion speed: +340%
‚úÖ Feature development: +180%  
‚ùå Configuration debugging: +420% (time LOST)

The issue? AI assistants don't just help code - they "improve" configs without permission.

Result:
‚Ä¢ 23% of dev time spent fixing AI modifications
‚Ä¢ 67% increase in deployment failures  
‚Ä¢ $87K in lost productivity Q3 alone

The solution isn't removing AI (too valuable) but setting boundaries.

We implemented ailock across the team:
‚úÖ AI retains full context for suggestions
‚úÖ Developers maintain config control
‚úÖ 95% reduction in AI-caused issues

ROI: $87K saved, team confidence restored.

Sometimes the best AI strategy is knowing when to say "you can look but don't touch."

### Leadership Insight Template
```
üí° What AI Coding Assistants Taught Me About Management

Interesting parallel between AI tools and team leadership:

AI assistants are incredibly helpful BUT they keep making unsolicited "improvements" to developers' configuration files.

Sound familiar? It's like that manager who:
‚úÖ Provides valuable guidance
‚ùå Constantly reorganizes your workspace "for efficiency"

Both scenarios create the same dynamic:
‚Ä¢ High value from the relationship
‚Ä¢ Frustration from boundary violations  
‚Ä¢ Reduced trust over time

The fix isn't avoiding the relationship - it's setting clear boundaries.

For AI: Tools like ailock let AI help without interfering
For management: Clear scope boundaries let leaders guide without micromanaging

Lesson: The best relationships (human or AI) respect autonomy while providing support.
