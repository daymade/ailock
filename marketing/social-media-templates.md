## 💬 Discord/Slack Messages

### Message 1: "The Casual Drop"

```
anyone else tired of AI assistants "optimizing" their configs?

just spent 2 hrs fixing what Cursor did to my .env 😤

found this thing called ailock - basically makes files read-only for AI
AI can still see everything for context but can't modify

10 sec setup: npm install -g ailock && ailock init

my configs are finally safe lol
```

### Message 2: "The Helper"

```
@here PSA for anyone using AI coding assistants:

If you've ever had:
- Copilot corrupt your .env
- Cursor break your docker-compose  
- Claude mess up your settings

Check out ailock - makes your configs read-only for AI
They can still read for context, just can't modify

Saved me hours this week already

## 💡 Remember

**Every piece of content should:**
1. Start with pain (relatable problem)
2. Agitate (make it worse/funny)
3. Solve (ailock as simple solution)
4. Call to action (try it now)

**The secret sauce:** We're not selling software. We're selling the feeling of being understood and the relief of a simple solution to a daily frustration.
