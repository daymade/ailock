## [Unreleased]

### Planned for Phase 2
- Git pre-commit hook integration
- Husky framework support
- Commit-time protection against locked file changes

### Planned for Phase 3
- Interactive terminal UI with Ink
- Workspace initialization wizard
- Enhanced status reporting and file management

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- üéâ Initial release of AI-Proof File Guard CLI
- ‚úÖ **Core CLI Framework**
  - Commander.js-based CLI with TypeScript
  - Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows, WSL)
  - Global NPM package installation (`npm install -g ailock`)

- üîí **File Locking System**
  - `ailock lock` command to protect files from modifications
  - `ailock unlock` command to restore file write permissions
  - Cross-platform file permission management:
    - Linux: `chmod` + `chattr +i` for immutable files
    - macOS: `chmod` + `chflags` for extended attributes
    - Windows: `attrib +R` + `icacls` for ACL management
    - WSL: Hybrid filesystem detection with fallback

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration System**
  - `.ailock` configuration file with gitignore-style syntax
  - Hierarchical configuration discovery (project ‚Üí parent directories)
  - Default protection patterns for common sensitive files
  - Support for glob patterns (`**/*.key`, `config/*.json`, etc.)
  - Comment and whitespace handling in configuration files

- üéõÔ∏è **Command Features**
  - `--verbose` flag for detailed operation output
  - `--dry-run` flag for preview mode without applying changes
  - Command-line pattern override (bypass .ailock configuration)
  - Comprehensive error handling with helpful messages
  - File status reporting (locked/unlocked state)

- üß™ **Testing Infrastructure**
  - Vitest-based testing framework
  - Unit tests for configuration parsing and platform adapters
  - Integration tests for full CLI workflows
  - Cross-platform test matrix
  - Mock filesystem for isolated testing

- üìö **Documentation**
  - Comprehensive README with usage examples
  - Technical specification documents (PRD, PROPOSAL, BACKGROUND)
  - API documentation for all core modules
  - Cross-platform installation and usage guides

### Technical Details
- **Dependencies**: Commander.js 14.0, fast-glob 3.3, chalk 5.4
- **Build System**: TypeScript 5.8 with ES2022 target
- **Platform Support**: Node.js 18+ with ESM modules
- **File Operations**: Native fs.promises with platform-specific command execution
- **Pattern Matching**: fast-glob for high-performance file discovery

### Security Features
- Path traversal protection with input validation
- Symlink handling with explicit configuration options
- Permission elevation detection and user prompts
- Graceful degradation when advanced features unavailable
- Fail-secure operation mode (abort on locking failures)

### Performance
- Batch file operations for improved efficiency
- Async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
- Smart caching of file status to avoid repeated system calls
- Optimized glob patterns with built-in ignore lists

## [0.0.1] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- Initial project setup and planning
- Technical architecture design
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Development roadmap and phase planning
